## Projects
1.	Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university
2.	Implemented logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plat passes quality assurance. 
3.	Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.
4.	Implement backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of handwritten digit recognition
5.	Debug the learning algorithms by examining the effects of bias vs variance and plotting learning curves
6.	Use SVM to build a spam classifier
7.	Implement K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. 
8.	Use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation on face images. 
9.	Implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network
10.	Use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies
